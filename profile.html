        Prabhu Deva (born 3 April 1973) is an Indian dance choreographer, film director, producer and actor who has worked predominantly in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, and Kannada language films.
        In a career spanning 32 years, he has performed and designed dancing styles and has garnered two National Film Awards for Best Choreography.
         In 2019, he was awarded the Padma Shri for his contributions to dance.
         with a series of acting roles in the 1990s and early 2000s, Prabhu Deva featured in several commercially successful films including Indhu is a 1994 Indian Kadhalan (1994), Love Birds (1996), Minsara Kanavu (1997) and VIP (1997).
         After further critically acclaimed performances in Kaathala Kaathala (1998), Vanathai Pola (2000), Pennin Manathai Thottu (2000), Alli Thandha Vaanam (2001) and Engal Anna (2004). Deva then failed to recreate the success of his 
         earlier films and his box office value began to decline and he subsequently made appearances in supporting roles in Tamil. He then successfully ventured into direction with the 2005 Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, and the
          success of the project prompted further offers for Deva as a director. He then went on to make highly profitable films in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi languages such as Pokkiri (2007), Shankar Dada Zindabad (2007), Wanted (2009), Rowdy Rathore (2012), R... Rajkumar (2013) and Singh is Bliing (2015).

    After a series of cameo appearances in songs from Tamil films, Prabhu Deva was given his first lead role by director Pavithran in the romantic drama film Indhu (1994). Appearing alongside actress Roja and Sarathkumar, Deva's ability to dance was fully utilised in the song sequences, with gaana and disco music thereafter being regularly featured in his films. He made his breakthrough as an actor with Shankar's sophomore film, the romantic drama Kadhalan (1994), where he portrayed a young student who first stands up against his lover's father and then an international terrorist.[9] The film was highly lauded for its technical prowess and went on to win four National Film Awards, while A. R. Rahman's songs and Deva's choreography, especially in the songs "Mukkabla" and "Urvasi Urvasi", became very popular across India.[12] Despite starring relative newcomers, the film went on to become the highest grossing Tamil film of 1994 and the commercial success made Deva a bankable actor.[13] The film also saw success through its dubbed Telugu and Hindi versions, creating a market for Deva in other Indian regional industries.
